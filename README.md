# Greater Goods Grocers

This repository is a sample mini-ecommerce website 
using guest-checkout to form the basis for a 10-12
week course on how to build such sites from scratch.

The technologies chosen will change over time, 
and each branch is designed to represent a chunk
of work to be completed in about a week.


This version was from 2019 and was a really ugly way of doing Vue.
However it served as the basis for a full rewrite using proper Vue conventions in the Fall course.
